This repo is a proof of my work done as a Python programming intern in CipherByte Technologies Internship Program.

### Task1 (MASTERMIND GAME )
This include a Game where two players play the game against each other\
Player 1 set a multi-digit number and Player 2 try to guess the number.\
If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.\
The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.\
Now, Player 2 to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.\
If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.
If not, then Player 2 wins the game.
